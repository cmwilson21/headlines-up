# Headlines Up - Headline Guessing Game
## This is still a work in progress.

In this game, a user will guess which headline was written by which news source.

A random headline selected from a group of five news sources will be presented to users. 
Users will choose via radio buttons which news source they think wrote the headline. 
Stats will be displayed at the end of each round.


### About
The purpose of this game is to hopefully reveal how some news sources pander to emotional responses on a subconscious leve. No news source is perfect, but some work more than others to extract emotions from their audience. Being aware of this can help filter emotional articles from factual articles.
